master will tell slaves when to activate enabling thier bt connections, 
after a minute of no connection or when all connections are establised the master will start playing and cycling with the current number of devices, 2-3 atm

buttons connected to master for pausing and cycling manually.


for testing, use nand and nor chips for multiplexer, and use internal dac setup for audio output.

		if it has start playing master
		pause slaves
	else
		limit device num to 2

-loop
